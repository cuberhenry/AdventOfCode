# AdventOfCode
These are my solutions to Advent of Code. I tried my best to make them modular so that any input works, including the test input, as long as it follows the paradigm described in the problem. The solutions are written in Java without a package.

# Use
Every solution uses files to read the input and standard output to display the answer. The program takes command line arguments to tell it which puzzle to solve and the name of the input file. The first command line argument is required, and it can only be 1 or 2. The second command line argument is optional, and it is the name of the input file. If no input file is specified, the program will attempt to read from "input.txt", and will quit if no such file exists.
