# AdventOfCode
These are my solutions to Advent of Code. I tried my best to make them modular so that any input works, including the test input, as long as it follows the paradigm described in the problem. The solutions are written in Java, and the .class files are from compiling in a MacBook terminal using arm64 assembly.
