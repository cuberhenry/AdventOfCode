# AdventOfCode
These are my solutions to Advent of Code. I tried my best to make them modular so that any input works, including the test input, as long as it follows the paradigm described in the problem. The solutions are written in Java without a package.

# Use
Every solution uses files to read the input and standard output to display the answer. The program takes a command line argument to tell it the name of the input file. If no input file is specified, the program will attempt to read from "input.txt", and will quit if no such file exists.
